This collection of Python tutorials are written for running on Jupyter notebooks.
The tutorials provide an introduction to the OpenVINO™ toolkit and explain how to
use the Python API and tools for optimized deep learning inference. You can run the
code one section at a time to see how to integrate your application with OpenVINO
libraries.

Notebooks with |binder logo| and |colab logo| buttons can be run without installing anything.
Once you have found the tutorial of your interest, just click the button next to
its name and the Jupyter notebook will start it in a new tab of a browser.

.. note::

   `Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`__ and `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`__
   are free online services with limited resources. For the best performance
   and more control, you should run the notebooks locally. Follow the
   :doc:`Installation Guide <notebooks_installation>` in order to get information
   on how to run and manage the notebooks on your machine.


More examples along with additional details regarding OpenVINO Notebooks are available in
