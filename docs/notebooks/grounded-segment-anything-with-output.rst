Object detection and masking from prompts with GroundedSAM (GroundingDINO + SAM) and OpenVINO
=============================================================================================

In this notebook, we provide the OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ optimization for the
combination of GroundingDINO + SAM =
`GroundedSAM <https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything>`__
on Intel¬Æ platforms.

GroundedSAM aims to detect and segment anything with text inputs.
GroundingDINO is a language-guided query selection module to enhance
object detection using input text. It selects relevant features from
image and text inputs and returns predicted boxes with detections. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from
input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate
masks for all objects in an image. We use box predictions from
GroundingDINO to mask the original image.

More details about the model can be found in the
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14159>`__, and the official
`repository <https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything>`__.

For faster computation and to limit RAM by default we use
``EfficientSAM`` for segmentation, but if you wish more accurate
segmentation you can select vanilla ``SAM``.

To suppress this warning, directly pass antialias=True (recommended, future default), antialias=None (current default, which means False for Tensors and True for PIL), or antialias=False (only works on Tensors - PIL will still use antialiasing). This also applies if you are using the inference transforms from the models weights: update the call to weights.transforms(antialias=True).

Run SAM model for the same image with the detected boxes from
GroundingDINO.

Please note that vanilla SAM and EfficientSAM have slightly different
detection formats. But inputs for both of them originate from
``boxes_filt`` which is result of the ``get_ov_grounding_output``. For
EfficientSAM we use ``detections.xyxy`` boxes obtained after
``boxes_filt`` is fed to ``Model.post_process_result``. While vanilla
SAM has it‚Äôs own preprocessing function ``transform_boxes``.

You can run interactive app with your own image and text prompts. To
define prompt specify comma (or conjunction) separated names of objects
you wish to segment. For demonstration, this demo already has two
predefined examples. If many object are crowded and overlapping please
increase threshold values in ``Advanced options``.
